### Automated Selection Algorithm

```python
def select_mcp_tool(query, context):
    # Keyword analysis
    project_keywords = ["our", "we", "this project", "previous", "decided", "implemented"]
    research_keywords = ["best practice", "latest", "compare", "research", "industry", "current"]
    
    # Intent classification
    if any(keyword in query.lower() for keyword in project_keywords):
        return "conport_primary"
    elif any(keyword in query.lower() for keyword in research_keywords):
        return "vertex_primary"
    elif "how to" in query.lower() or "tutorial" in query.lower():
        return "vertex_primary"
    elif "why did we" in query.lower() or "when did we" in query.lower():
        return "conport_primary"
    else:
        return "hybrid_approach"  # Use both
```

## üéØ Conclusion

**Neither ConPort nor Vertex AI alone is sufficient for optimal outcomes.** The magic happens in their intelligent orchestration:

- **ConPort provides the foundation** - your project's memory and context
- **Vertex AI provides the expansion** - access to global knowledge and generation capabilities
- **Together they create exponential value** - context-aware research and research-informed context

The future of AI-assisted development lies not in choosing between tools, but in creating intelligent systems that know when and how to leverage each tool's unique strengths.

**Recommendation**: Implement both with intelligent routing logic that automatically selects the optimal tool(s) based on query intent and context needs.
