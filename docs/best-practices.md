## 1. Effective Communication with Roo Commander

*   **Be Clear and Specific:** When giving instructions or asking questions, be as clear and specific as possible. Provide sufficient context to help the agent understand your intent.
    *   *Good Example:* "Refactor the `getUser` function in `userService.ts` to use async/await and add error handling for database connection issues."
    *   *Less Effective:* "Fix the user service."
*   **State Your Goals:** Clearly define the overall objective of your task. This allows the agent to make better autonomous decisions.
*   **Break Down Complex Requests (If Necessary):** While the agent can handle complex tasks, if you have a very large or multi-faceted objective, you can still break it down into logical high-level phases for Roo Commander. The agent will then autonomously manage the sub-steps.

## 2. Leveraging Agentic Capabilities

*   **Trust Autonomous Decisions (with Oversight):** The system is designed to operate autonomously. Allow it to take initiative. Monitor its actions, especially initially, and provide corrective feedback if needed. This feedback is crucial for the Continuous Learning System.
*   **Utilize Proactive Suggestions:** Pay attention to suggestions from the Proactive Orchestration Engine. These are designed to help you avoid risks, seize opportunities, and improve code quality.
*   **Ask Complex Questions:** Don't hesitate to ask complex analytical or architectural questions. The Agentic RAG Engine is designed to retrieve and synthesize information from various sources within your project.
    *   Example: "What are the performance trade-offs of our current caching strategy for the product catalog?"

## 3. Context Management

*   **Keep ConPort Updated:** The tool relies heavily on the information stored in ConPort (tasks, decisions, ADRs, code patterns, documentation). Ensure this information is accurate and up-to-date. The tool itself will contribute to this, but major architectural shifts or new project goals should be reflected.
*   **Session Context:** Be mindful of the current session's focus. While the agent has access to broader project context, information directly related to the ongoing session objective is often prioritized.

## 4. Prompt Engineering (If Directly Interacting with Lower-Level Prompts - Advanced)

While Roo Commander handles most prompt engineering, if you are in a scenario where you are crafting prompts for specific sub-tasks or custom extensions:

*   **Provide Sufficient Context:** Include relevant code snippets, error messages, or architectural details.
*   **Use Clear Role-Playing:** If asking for code generation, specify the language, framework, and desired style.
*   **Specify Output Format:** If you need output in a particular format (e.g., JSON, Markdown table), request it.

## 5. Performance Optimization

*   **Monitor System Performance:** The Ultimate Agentic Orchestrator includes performance monitoring. Pay attention to any feedback regarding system speed or efficiency.
*   **Address Bottlenecks:** If the POE or CLS identifies performance bottlenecks (e.g., in specific code modules or inefficient queries), prioritize addressing these.
*   **Efficient Queries:** When querying for information, try to be specific to reduce the search space for the RAG engine.

## 6. System Maintenance and Updates

*   **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Ensure that ROOPORT, ConPort, MCP servers, and any underlying AI models or libraries are kept up-to-date as recommended by their maintainers.
*   **Review Learning Proposals:** The Continuous Learning System will generate proposals for system improvements. While many can be autonomous, periodically review these (if a mechanism is provided) to understand system evolution.
*   **Monitor ConPort Health:** Ensure the ConPort database is functioning correctly and that data is being logged as expected.

## 7. Security Considerations

*   **API Keys and Credentials:** If any components connect to external services requiring API keys, manage these securely according to best practices (e.g., environment variables, secret management tools). Do not embed credentials directly in code or configuration files accessible to the agent.
*   **Data Privacy:** Be mindful of the data being processed by the AI components, especially if it involves sensitive information. Ensure compliance with relevant data privacy regulations.
*   **Autonomous Actions Review:** While the system is designed for autonomy, for critical operations (e.g., production deployments, major refactoring of core systems), consider implementing review gates if your organizational policy requires it, even if the agent has high confidence. The definition of "critical" should be established for your project.

## 8. Feedback is Key

*   **Implicit Feedback:** Your natural workflow (correcting code, changing files after an agent action, successfully completing tasks initiated by the agent) provides valuable implicit feedback.
*   **Explicit Feedback (If Available):** If Roo Commander or other interfaces provide mechanisms for explicit feedback (ratings, comments), use them. This directly helps the CLS improve the system.

By following these best practices, you can maximize the benefits of the Ultimate Agentic Coding Tool, improve its performance over time, and maintain a productive and secure development environment.
