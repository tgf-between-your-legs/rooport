## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

ROOPORT's architecture is centered around **CONVEX (the Ultimate Agentic Orchestrator - UO)**, which intelligently manages a "dual-brain" system. It routes queries and tasks to:
- **ConPort (CP)**: For deep, persistent project-specific knowledge, history, and context.
- **AI Providers (Vertex AI, etc.)**: For general knowledge, research, and advanced generative capabilities.
