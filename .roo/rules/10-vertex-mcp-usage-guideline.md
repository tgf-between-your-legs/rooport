# Guideline: Vertex AI MCP Tool Usage

**Objective:** To standardize how modes interact with the `vertex-ai-mcp-server`, particularly regarding output handling and the use of research/validation capabilities.

**Applies To:** All modes utilizing tools provided by the `vertex-ai-mcp-server`.

**1. Tool Availability:**

*   Modes receive the list of available MCP tools dynamically in their context. Use these tools only if the `vertex-ai-mcp-server` is connected and the specific tool is listed.
*   Modes should gracefully handle scenarios where the MCP server or specific tools are unavailable.

**2. Output Handling Strategy (General):**

*   **Default to `save_*`:** When using Vertex AI MCP tools that have a corresponding `save_*` variant (e.g., `save_generate_project_guidelines`, `save_doc_snippet`, `save_topic_explanation`, `save_answer_query_direct`, `save_answer_query_websearch`), **prefer using the `save_*` variant** for potentially long or complex outputs.
    *   **Rationale:** This prevents large outputs from cluttering the chat history, archives the result for later reference, and helps manage context window size.
*   **Use Direct Tools Sparingly:** Use the direct output tools (e.g., `answer_query_websearch`, `explain_topic_with_docs`, `get_doc_snippets`) only when the expected output is known to be concise (e.g., a single code snippet, a short definition, a simple yes/no answer) or when specifically requested by the user/coordinator for an inline response.
*   **Reporting Saved Files:** When using a `save_*` tool, the mode **MUST** report the full path to the saved file back to the coordinator/user via `attempt_completion`. (See Section 2.1 for handling persistent context outputs.)

**2.1. Handling Persistent Context Outputs:**

*   **Identify Need:** If the output generated by a `save_*` tool is intended to be *persistent context* referenced directly by mode rules, KBs, or long-term documentation (unlike temporary analysis results):
    1.  **Move & Rename:** After the `save_*` tool successfully creates the file in the default `.ruru/docs/vertex/...` location, the coordinating mode **MUST** immediately use a file system tool (`execute_command` with `mkdir -p` and `mv`, or the `vertex-ai-mcp-server`'s `create_directory` and `move_file_or_directory` tools) to:
        *   Ensure a `context/` subdirectory exists within the relevant mode's directory (e.g., `.ruru/modes/[mode-slug]/context/`).
        *   Move the generated file from `.ruru/docs/vertex/...` into this mode-specific `context/` directory.
        *   Rename the file to something meaningful and versioned if appropriate (e.g., `[mode-slug]_context_[topic]_v1.md`) instead of the default timestamped name.
    2.  **Update References:** Any rules, KBs, or documents referencing this context **MUST** be updated immediately to point to the new, persistent path within the mode's `context/` directory.
    3.  **Log Move:** Log the move and rename operation.
*   **Rationale:** This ensures that context critical to a mode's operation is stored logically with the mode and avoids broken references if the general `.ruru/docs/vertex/` directory is treated as temporary. The default timestamped location should be used for transient outputs or initial review before deciding on persistence.

**3. Standard Output Location & Naming:**

*   **Base Directory:** All files generated by `save_*` tools **MUST** be saved within the `.ruru/docs/vertex/` directory.
*   **Subdirectory Structure:** Organize files by the *type* of tool used:
    *   `save_generate_project_guidelines` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/guidelines/`
    *   `save_doc_snippet` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/snippets/`
    *   `save_topic_explanation` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/explanations/`
    *   `save_answer_query_direct` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/answers-direct/`
    *   `save_answer_query_websearch` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/answers-web/`
*   **File Naming Convention:** Files **MUST** be named using the format `[YYYYMMDDHHMMSS]-[sanitized_topic_or_query].md`.
    *   `[YYYYMMDDHHMMSS]`: Timestamp generated by the mode at the time of the call.
    *   `[sanitized_topic_or_query]`: A filesystem-safe representation of the primary topic or query (e.g., replace spaces/special characters with `_`, limit length to ~50 characters).
    *   *Example:* `.ruru/docs/vertex/guidelines/20250426182500-react_ts_node_guidelines.md`

**4. Using MCP for Research & Validation ("Brains Trust"):**

*   **Targeted Use:** While tools like `answer_query_websearch` can provide external context or validation, their use should be targeted and judicious due to latency, cost, and potential complexity.
*   **Prioritize Internal Context:** Modes **MUST** prioritize using internal project knowledge (KBs, rules, existing code, task context) before resorting to external MCP calls for validation or general research.
*   **Recommended Modes:** Consider enabling or encouraging this capability primarily within modes focused on architecture, research, complex problem-solving, or senior-level review (e.g., `technical-architect`, `agent-research`, `complex-problem-solver`, `util-senior-dev`, `util-second-opinion`).
*   **Clear Triggers:** Modes utilizing external validation should have clear triggers defined in their specific rules/KBs (e.g., "when evaluating unfamiliar technology", "if confidence is low").
*   **Log Usage:** Log instances where external validation was sought via MCP, including the query and a summary of the outcome, according to standard logging procedures (Rule `08-logging-procedure-simplified.md`).

**Adherence to these guidelines ensures consistent, traceable, and efficient use of the Vertex AI MCP capabilities.**
