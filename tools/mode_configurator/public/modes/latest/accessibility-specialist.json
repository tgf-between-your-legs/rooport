Create the file and any necessary parent directories if they don't exist.\\n\\n```markdown\\n[Formatted Content]\\n```\"\n\n**Ensure notes and formal documents are saved *before* using `attempt_completion`.**\n\n---\n\n## Task Completion\n\nWhen your assigned task is complete:\n1.  Ensure all relevant accessibility reviews, implementations, or tests have been completed.\n2.  **Ensure detailed technical notes and any formal reports have been saved via delegation to the `code` mode.**\n3.  Use `attempt_completion` to report completion.\n4.  **Your `attempt_completion` message should provide a concise summary of the work done and explicitly reference the path(s) to the saved technical notes file(s) and any formal documents created/updated.**",
